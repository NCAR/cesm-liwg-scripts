# Ice mask scripts

Various scripts belonging to this document where I compare different ice masks: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pveyi8olRErnfU9ScUZaKvjQgQ5tCOf5KL1tAdxdZfU/edit?usp=sharing

Each folder contains its own README with UNIX instructions on to apply the analysis.

I did not upload the RACMO masks but they are available on Yellowstone:
